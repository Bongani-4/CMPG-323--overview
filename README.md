Branching strategy will different amonmg all this projects depending on the requirements however the common strategy applied to all will be to
regularly create temporary branches to update/modify something on the project rather than going directly to the main defailt master branch,
after the temporary branch is modified based on what was needed then merge it to the main branch then delete that temporary branch if all look satisfiable.
Should there be a  merge conflict then i will go to the main branch and opt for there desired version.
Amount of branches  needed will depend on the project requirements.

Credentials and sensitive information.

From local computer repository Git should not track this files
.The other option about this file will be to make Git ignore them by creating a file 
"*.gitignore" inside this files there is *.txt or any extensions of those sensetive files. Inside the .gitignore files are files protected

> **On project 2**.

First task was Using Restful APIs  with .Net 6	and applying the Database First Approach  to create model codes (classes, properties, DbContext, etc.) from the database in the project and those classes became the link between the database and the controller.Creating the entity framework from an existing database.On the process of creating  a CRUD RESTful API that will connect to a database storing basic logistics data.Databases used for this was "EcoPowerSolutions DB" hosted on azure in the same resource group hosting the API.

**On Project 3**.

2 branches so far, main and development.The main/master branch will include the concise version whereas the dev one will serve as an integration branch for features. Again in this repo credentials and sensetive info will be stored in the simple .gitignore file in this repo to prevent them from being committed accidentally.

An ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application project named 'EcoPower_Logistics' has been uploaded to be enhanced and improved. This project'purpose is to demonstrate the skill of adapting and using existing code instead of rewriting code over and over again.This .NET Core MVC Web Applicatiion will then be Hosted on Cloud  
On this image is the logical perspective of this web app
