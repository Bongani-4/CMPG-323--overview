![Project](https://github.com/Bongani-4/CMPG-323-Overview--35016752/assets/140083292/ff36abef-8d34-42ee-940a-ee81a51a59cf)

Branching strategy will different among all this projects depending on the requirements however the common strategy applied to all will be to
regularly create temporary branches to update/modify something on the project rather than going directly to the main defailt master branch,
after the temporary branch is modified based on what was needed then i will merge it to the main branch then delete that temporary branch if all look satisfiable.
Should there be a  merge conflict then i will go to the main branch and opt for there desired version.
Amount of branches i will need will depend on the project requirements.

Credentials and sensitive information.
From my local computer repository i can opt not to let Git track this files 
or delete them manually on file explorer repository.The other option about this file will be to make Git ignore them by creating a file 
"*.gitignore" inside this files i write *.txt or any extensions of the files i want git to ignore or simply go to https://github.com/github/gitignore. Inside the .gitignore files are files protected,how?, Git ignore them when tracking files in my project's repositories..This is what will be applied to my projects sensetive files.

**On Project3**.
2 branches so far, main and development.The main/master branch will include the concise version whereas the dev one will serve as an integration branch for features. Again in this repo credentials and sensetive info will be stored in the simple .gitignore file in this repo to prevent them from being committed accidentally.

An ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application project named 'EcoPower_Logistics' has been uploaded to be enhanced and improved. This project'purpose is to demonstrate the skill of adapting and using existing code instead of rewriting code over and over again.This .NET Core MVC Web Applicatiion will then be Hosted on Cloud
